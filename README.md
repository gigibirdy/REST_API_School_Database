# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree v2 - REST API Project

This project was developed with REST API design, Node.js, Express to create API routes, the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence and Postman for testing. With this API, authenticated users will be able to administer a school database containing information about courses: authorized users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.
